Synthetic Intelligence (SI), also called Artificial General Intelligence, is the next evolutionary step beyond current Artificial Intelligence, which includes Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, etc.  We believe that once achieved in a fully commercial form, this new technology promises to revolutionise the world as we know it.

We are an association of SI enthusiasts, researchers, and practitioners, committed to the goal of advancing, promoting, and securing true Synthetic Intelligence/AGI.

The term "Synthetic Intelligence" was originally coined by the philosopher John Haugeland, who differentiated it from "Artificial Intelligence"â€‹ (AI) by using an analogy comparing artificial diamonds with synthetic diamonds. Artificial diamonds, technically known as Cubic Zirconia, look like diamonds to the untrained eye, but possess none of the true diamond qualities.  In contrast, a synthetic diamond is a stone produced by industrial process. It is a real diamond with all the qualities of a geologically-produced diamond.

We invite you to join in the conversations and live events, and become a participant in this technological revolution.
